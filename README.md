# HEART-FAILURE-PREDICTION

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart failure in patients using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains clinical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other medical indicators. By analyzing these features, the model aims to assist in early detection of heart disease risk.

## Features
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, normalization)

Exploratory data analysis (visualizations, correlations)

Model building (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

Prediction system for new patient data

## Technologies Used
Python 3

Google Colab

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

## Dataset
Source: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iFgvoXIsCWsmUHuJcceJ-yVD6QmDIW-b/view

Attributes: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, etc.

## Results
Best performing model: Random Forest with 90% accuracy

Key insights: Age and Cholesterol have highest correlation with heart failure risk
